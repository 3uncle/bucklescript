[WARNING]

These are opinionated suggestions based on my programming experience,
it might _change_ over time.

// === Dirty but useful hacks
//
// . Escape the type system
//
// The `Obj.magic` provides a way to escape the type system, it is like `reinterpret_cast` in
// C++, it is recommended to write functions with name `unsafe_` to do such hacks when really necessary
//
// [source,ocaml]

=== Optimizations

[NOTE]
======
BuckleScript is  a young project  and moves very fast, this will be updated accordingly
======

==== Performance of stdlib


==== Optimize callbacks
